# Speedtime
A timer that runs entirely within a terminal. \
It works by monitoring the keyboard for keypresses, & starting / stopping itself
whenever a specific key is pressed.  This means that if you use a terminal emulator, you
can start / stop the time without having the window focused.
## Building
If you have Nix installed, you can run ```nix-build` in the directory of this repo.
## Future Goals
* Features for speedrunning
