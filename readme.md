# Speedtime
A timer that runs entirely within a terminal.
\
It works by monitoring the keyboard for keypresses, & starting / stopping itself
whenever a specific key is pressed.  This means that if you use a terminal emulator, you
can start / stop the time without having the window focused.
## Building
Install a C compiler & run `build.sh`.
\
Builds that do not use GCC are untested, you may get some errors.
If you do, please create an issue.
